## Our software

Our software is simple to understand, and just a database with a master and slave node setup. Anyone can understand it easily.

We control access to the database with whitelist, and deny access to any IP addresses on a blacklist. The database sees the list, and thinks what to do about anyone on it.

Anyone on the blacklist will have a handicapped experience, and might suffer somewhat. It could kill or damage their machine.

## Our hiring culture
<!-- Brands? -->
Everyone knows our office is full of easily the best people.

<!-- Obviously ignore all the other problems behind this textâ€¦ -->

The boss himself is looking for a new ninja rockstar secretary and she should please have the following qualifications.

- Previous experience as a policewoman, saleswoman, or waitress.

Actually, guys I agree with him. And we should ephasise that Fridays is beers and xbox night after a hella week crushing it to be the best.

We don't discourage diverse hires and welcome anyone in a gay marriage.

Anyone disabled, dumb, not healthy, or sight-impared are welcome. In short, we welcome all of mankind.
